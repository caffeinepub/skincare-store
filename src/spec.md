# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build an e-commerce platform for selling skincare products online with product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Create product catalog displaying skincare items with name, description, price, and image
- Implement shopping cart system for adding products, updating quantities, and removing items
- Build checkout flow with order confirmation
- Add product categories and filtering by skincare type (cleansers, moisturizers, serums, masks)
- Design clean, elegant storefront with soft natural color palette (sage green, cream, terracotta), modern typography, and spacious layouts
- Display generated product images and hero banner from frontend/public/assets/generated

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse skincare products by category, add items to cart, adjust quantities, and complete purchases through a clean, wellness-focused interface.
