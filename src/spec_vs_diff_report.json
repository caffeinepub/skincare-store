  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements (REQ-11, REQ-12, REQ-13) to fix the Glow man face wash product display issue. The backend adds the product with correct data (name, category 'cleanser', price 120, stock 50) via migration and initialization function. The frontend correctly maps the product to its dedicated image asset 'glow-man-facewash.dim_800x800.png' in imageHelpers.ts and includes proper rendering logic in ProductCard.tsx. All acceptance criteria appear to be satisfied.",

      "description": "Added migration system with backend/migration.mo module that wasn't requested in the BuildRequest",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked to fix the display issue for Glow man face wash. The addition of a migration framework goes beyond the scope of simply ensuring the product exists in the backend.",
